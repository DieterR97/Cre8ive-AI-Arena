<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

### Implementation Process

- Used `bootstrap` for the responsiveness and layout of site.
- `PostgreSQL` used as backend with `pgAdmin 4`.
- `bcrypt` used for hashing passwords.

#### Highlights

- Users can register and log in.
- Users can have an overview of all 3 settlements as well as view them individually.
- Users can craft components.
- Users can buy and sell items.
- Users can ship between settlements.
- Admin can adjust the value of items.

#### Challenges

- Getting the crafting functionality to work.
- Having correct relations and joining of tables.
- Some styling aspects created challenges.
- Frontend of login/registering posed a challenge.

### Future Implementation

- With a day or two extra we would be able to implement all the required functionality.
